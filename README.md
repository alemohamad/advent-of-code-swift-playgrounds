# Advent of Code in Swift Playgrounds

My collection of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzle solutions, all written in Swift Playgrounds!

2024 is my first year diving into these puzzles, but I’m also planning to tackle challenges from previous years—working my way back to 2015. It’s going to be quite the journey, but hey, that’s part of the fun!

If you’re feeling inspired, I’ve included a template to help you get started solving these puzzles in Swift Playgrounds with your own solutions. Let’s see how far we can go!
